# What is ___?
In today's society, accessibility options for those with severe motor impairment are unfortunately lacking. When it comes to participating in or even just watching videos, there are hundreds if not thousands of individuals unable to navigate YouTube easily, and while there is hardware dedicated to providing these people the ability to control the computer through the usage of very few and easy to activate inputs, there is a lack of software that makes use of this hardware. ___ aims to help these people by providing the ability to navigate YouTube, the most prominent entertainment website on the internet, with only two inputs (though more are supported).
